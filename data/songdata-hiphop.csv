1990,Salt-n-Peppa,,"Oh yeah, oh yeah
You know life is all about expression
You only live once, and you're not coming back
So express yourself, yeah

Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body

Now Joe wanna be like Bob
Bob got it goin' on with no job
And everything Rob got he got from Robin
And everything she got she got ho-hoppin'
My girl Jilly wanna be like Jackie
Fat rope chains and I think that's wick-wacky
Tom and Dick wanna be like Harry
Little do they know he's bitin' on Barry
Stan was a scam, but Vinnie's legit
Mercedes coupe hometroop with no kit
A businessman with a beeper for a reason
Not like Tim because it's in this season


Oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey Pep, you up next

Yes, I'm Pep and there ain't nobody
Like my body, yes, I'm somebody
No, I'm sorry, I'm-a rock this Mardis Gras
Until the party ends, friends
Yes, I'm blessed, and I know who I am
I express myself on every jam
I'm not a man, but I'm in command
Hot damn, I got an all-girl band
And I wear the gear, yeah, I wanna wear it, too
I don't care, dear, go ahead and stare (oooo)
Afraid to be you, livin' in fear (boo)
Expression is rare, I dare you


Oh yeah, oh yeah...
Yo, excuse us while we rap
Go ahead, girls, express yourself!

My party, your party, anytime drop in
Cold hip-hop is always rockin'
Don't you like it when the music drop
Jump, spread out, and stop?
Now bring in the go-go (uh-oh)
Look at how my butt go rock from left to the right
You wanna step to me, groove me
I know you wanna do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight

At my door they're bum-rushin'
To hear the percussion
Sound of my go-go band
I've long ago learned my lesson
It's all about expression
Will the real Salt and Pepa please stand?
And...

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, come on and work that body

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe

Express yourself, oh yeah, oh yeah
Express yourself",Hip-Hop,1
1990,Candyman,Knockin' Boots,"Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
Will still end up knockin the boots

Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you


At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song


Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)


Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real

1990,Digital Underground,The Humpty Dance,"All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Verse Two]
People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Breakdown]
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

[Outro]
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace, and Humptiness forever",Hip-Hop,3
1990,The west coast rap all-stars,We're all in the same gang,"Gun is Cocked and Fired
I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
All the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
One of your victims was a three year old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(With your badself)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight a student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother-
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great

[Verse 2: Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Doing time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke
I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke)
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off of white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America
Get busy, Humpty
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what ya like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

1990,D-Nice,Call me D-Nice,"(My name is D Nice, my name is D Nice
My name, my name is D Nice
My name is D Nice
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it)
Yo, this is D-Nice and I'm about to drop some funky lyrics on this track I made up, you know what I'm saying, huh, yea and you don't stop, yo

[Verse 1: D Nice]
My name is D-Nice although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
See every episode remains in this mode
Very cool, very calm, there's no sweat in my palm
I just pick up the mic, proceed with a song
I get right to the point, my competition's not long or short
It's like a sport hanging in the middle
But now if you're puzzled, let me kick the whole riddle
That my name is Derrick and if I didn't mention
D-Nice is just a description
It describes the kid on the mic
I'm the TR-808, huh, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]
My name is D Nice
Take, ta-take, taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

[Verse 2: D Nice]
I start to think, a very big conscious all around me
Who will be the sucker MC to try to doubt me
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or him
But I'm like a tree and every lyric is a limb
You throw it on the turntable, very unstable
But you gamble because you need that example
There's a 1000 MC's on the planet earth now
What is the word you say to get hers
Some like to explain, some talk educated
Some like McBoo, he's X-rated
I like to think of myself as a pure rebel
A radical thinker on a musical level
Cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss
Wherever I go, yo, it seems I can't be dissed
Cause my name is D-Nice but all the girls call me Derrick
It ran through my crew so I guess I've inherit
The job of explaining and also retaining
The fact D-Nice is remaining
Not a king nor a prince but as a teacher
With dope beats like this, I know I'm gonna reach ya
So now I don't think you should all despise
This fact D-Nice is on a rise
Straight to the top like a bubble of water
It's a slaughter so I think you oughta
Think realistically, not egotistically
It's suicide if you even think of dissing me
Cause if you try, I'm a make you wait
To learn the reason I'm the 808, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: D Nice]
I live in the Bronx by the D and the 4
Writing lyrics, it's addictive, writing more and more and more
About peace, about wars, about whores
Breaking city laws to me become a chore
I wear no jeri curls but I still pull girls
I don't slur my words when I rap cause that's wack, huh
But in fact, I do not slack
When I drop the funky, funky lyric on a track
I'm not conceited when I walk the streets
And you can tell by the words that I speak
That I'm not just another brother on the mic
Cause the females love me and they call me D-Nice",Hip-Hop,5
1991,LL Cool J,Around the way girl,"(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Hook]
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Hook]
(To the bridge)

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way",Hip-Hop,1
1991,Yo-Yo ft. Ice Cube,You can't play with my Yo-Yo,"[Ice Cube]
Yo Jinx, man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls sympin', man!
Who you think fit the category?

[Yo-Yo]
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O. Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played like I was made by Mattel.
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman
[?] superior to handle any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers, they'll reply “No…”

[Hook: Ice Cube]
“You can't play with my Yo-Yo!”
(Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt
To the fact I hit the 8-ball often
The earrings I wear are called Dolphins
Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and
If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother)
I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady-like!
But I'm a lady, who will pull a stunt though
I K-O suckas, and even hit the blunt
So what you wanna do? You must play hit and run
It through to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter than a hot whore in snow
Tell 'em, Ice Cube!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
(What's your name baby?)

[Verse 2]
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but no, I'm not a Duncan
As I rap, Chilly Chill bring in the funk and
I'll steal yo man, that's if he is a hunk and
He'll call me Baby Yo, or even Pumpkin
I may be Buttercup, or even Miss Yo
We had dinner, and now we drinking Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's getting cozy
You're home alone, so now you getting nosy
You're kind of young
So of course you had to call my place
Hang up in my face
It's a sad case of who your man's giving the dollars
What? Yep, I put lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler
But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?!
But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo
Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha!
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo!
Yeah, tell em whats up

[Verse 3: Yo-Yo]
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That you're ""weak"" as Monday through Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio
And next to me?
Ha! You're not fly, yo?!
You lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?!
Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not living like that verse
Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on destruction
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
They know what time it is
Fools, yeah!
You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo
I'm out. I thought you knew!

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s!
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 4]
I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on
But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, ""More, more!""
I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior
Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we dare to take the stand
And diss back all the men
Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet
If we wanna live with justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em!

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""peoples',"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'
It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number
And then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day
She's what you wanna know about, then you call up
And it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh, that’s why she’s scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means somethin' gifted
The first two letters' the same
But the last is somethin' different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word
Rhymin' with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother
Who had another, like, a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast
'Cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you
And you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave
And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment
Bust it! That wasn't the thing
It must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings
I said: ""Let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave.""
She said: ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!""
I said: ""Now child, please! You gots to leave
Come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said: ""Now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing
You shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round
Runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Excitin', isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messin' with

Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify our owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'

We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Oh, what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
Hmmm, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brainlocked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
'Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar
Fly kit with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin' more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin to myself—oh, you big, big dummy
Just my luck that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (Not the cash)
Oh, yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein' in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like, ""I love you so much""
But wishin' she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one, I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

[Hook: Erick Sermon]
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith]
The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""Fly girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what cha sayin'?)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah I gots to get this""
(P, cool—she couldn't be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid boomin' figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten Gs on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (Oh, P, you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty, sip Moet and bug (So did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?"" (What?)
""I'm pregnant"" (Pregnant? Damn)
Yeah, and the child is yours
So to fellas who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
'Cause she's a gold digger

'Cause she's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger

That's why, men in the 90s must watch themselves
'Cause ladies of the 80s got hip and went for self
With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half
That means the house goes,—
—The car,—
—You, and half your cash
What a price to pay, but if you play you pay
'Cause women of the world they got smart today
They flash a smile and profile,—
—A pucker with a strut,—
—Try to move in—
—Knock the boots
And got stuck, with alimony payments
Time to meet Judge Wapner
You try to flip and cut, but she smiles 'cause she gotcha
You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words—
—""I do""
But look now; you lost the house,—
—The car
Eatin' TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
Boy, you picked a winner
But what goes around, comes around
That's why she wheels the Benz
And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger

Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you down, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, cause you're the biggest duck in town
You've got to relax, we got to kick back

Forget it, act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you

Make me act loco, then switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight!
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that Fred is dead
Deader than a doornail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

I'm feelin manly and your shaker's comin in handy
Slide off my clothes from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin you around Delware before I enter
Turn to seduction from face hips to feet
A wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete
Now since you got the body of the year, come and get the award
Here's a hint - it's like a long sharp sword
Flip tail, so let me see you shake it up like dice
The way you shake your rump is turnin mighty men to mice
But A Plus got a surprise that's a back breaker

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
(‘Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you're in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (hell yeah!)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Gettin' funky on the mic, like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah!) So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit
That's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit I'ma have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

""Yo what the fuck is wrong with you?""
""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

[Verse 1: Bo$$]
I don't really wanna feel
Like I'm in a daze so I smoke big kill
Just to deal with the ills like this fucked up trip (damn)
My skills ain't paying bills
And it's fucking with me and my grip (I hear you)
I drink that St. Ide's shit
And smoke a ticket at the same time
Drop a wicked bomb on my naughty nature
I'm livin' foul like a Knickerbocker (you livin' foul?)
Bitch I'm not the woman to sleep but I'm lost (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ole' ""I'm tired of niggas""
Trying to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing
His little trick bitch ass in another direction
Then don't even use protection
I hate stupid shit assholes can avoid
Yo! And if worse came to worse I'll run a fraud on unemployed
Cause who the fuck cares that I got gray hairs and can't sleep
Know what I mean? (Yeah hell yeah, that's deep)

Deeper and deeper .... ""What can I do?""
Deeper and deeper .... ""What can I do?""

""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

[Verse 2: Bo$$]
Every now and then I start flipping and get to thinkin'
Bout deep shit beyond all that bullshit
I shoot at people (yeah I know what you mean)
But fuck it I'm evil
And I'm hip to every bitch trying to get a grip
And every nigga trying to get a grip but fuck that shit
And I say fuck that shit with my mighty middle finger
I'm heavy off into this rap shit, bucking singers
Yo I think I'm getting tense (word?)
Cause my dollars ain't making no fucking sense; but then again
It's probably all that chronic that I smoked
I use to be like that when I was out there slanging dope
And lately I been flipping on some old paranoid shit
Like looking fuckers up and down trying to start shit (""What can I do?"")
Cause I'm a hard bitch (So why don't you just soften up?)
I try to be cool but I get caught up when I go to clubs, straight up
I don't even trust myself (yo, you can trust me)
Fuck I know? (I'm just like you)
Right, that's deep

For inside she come, she say de posse get flat come

[Verse 3: Bo$$]
Aye yo, I got them buck-wild thrills, living foul kills
I'm trying to get to Watts but I'm stuck in Baldwin Hills (damn)
Trying to find myself for real though, check it
If I just rewind myself I'll see it ain't that hectic
Y'all don't hear me talking but its time to get a stack
Cause I'm about a second away, from going back
To the corner slangin dope (now you know you don't wanna do that shit)
Gankin cluckers, jackin high, cappin marks
I may be losin' my mind but better that than my heart (I hear you)
I talk a lot of shit but I can back it all the fuck up
I'm real cool people until some bullshit get brung up
Look here, believe me I ain't comin out my crib
Tryin to snap on life and run out and do some dumb shit
So I'll be takin another sip to relax me
And get them problems out my mind that distract me
Life is workin on my last nerve (yeah I hear you G)
I'll see yo' ass next week, peace (yo that shit is deep)

You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block

Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga, ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote (What you tote?)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics
The shit is depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad 'cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle, you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I Rap-A-Lot
Pack the gat a lot, the flav's 'bout to drop, uh

Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I'm straight rap great, busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on PRO-Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear, your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl's butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Twenty-one, ninety-four, mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn, now explore
The flava in ya ear, it's The Boyscout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that's it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like that
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS, 97, KISS, bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy, (burn 'em in the flames)

[Interlude]
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee, uh, blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Um damn, Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me, was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears?
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you (Now what?)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break food on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

1994,Outkast,Player's Ball,"[Intro: Rico Wade]
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

[Hook : Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um...

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one..

1995,Coolio ft. L.V.,Gangsta's Paradise,"[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook 1: LV]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook 1]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?

*beep*

Hi Daddy, how you doing, this is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night
Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more cause you busy n all that, but you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

*beep*

That shit is real fucked up what you did!
I hooked you up with my girl and shit you fucked her every time you see her, you don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying!
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, ""why the fuck Big don't want me?""

*beep*

Yo Big this is Quita, Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that!

*beep*

Yeah motherfucker this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me, you be disappearing and shit, and I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call alright?

*beep*

[Verse 1: Biggie]
When it comes to sex, I’m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it’s stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn’t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack
You’ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back

[Hook: Faith Evans & Biggie]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’ all of a sudden

I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Togehter we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Hook: Boyz II Men]

You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby

In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids

Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?

So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

[Verse One: Lil' Kim]
Yeauhhh, I Momma, Miss Ivana
Usually rock the Prada, sometimes Gabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches
Puff Daddy pump the Hummer for the summer
I follow -- in the E-Class with the goggles
96 models, Bad Click on the stroll
(Tell em how we roll) Cruise control
Nuttin make a woman feel betta
Than Berrettas and Amarettas, butta leathers and mad cheddaz
Chillin in a Benz with my ami-gos
Tryin to stick a nigga for his pe-sos
If you say so's, then I'm the same chick
That you wanna get with, lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot, if not don't test the poom poom
Nanny nanny, punanny donny, heyyy!

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Heyyy, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)

[Verse Two: Puffy (Kim moaning in the background), Lil' Kim]
How you like it baby? Uhh, from the front
Uhh, from the back, give that ass a smack

Can't work the middle, plus his thing too little
Let me grab your ta-ta's, do the cha-cha
Make you scream Pa-pa, you da best, Da Da
Now watch mama, go up and down dick to jaw crazy
Uhh! Say my name baby (okay)
Before you nut, I'mma dribble down your butt cheeks
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a littleI'm drinkin babies, then I cracks for the Mercedes
Act shady, and feel my three-eighty *gun cocks*
Or the raven, oohwee I see
Your girl ain't a ""Freak Like Me"", or Adina
Huh, can't fade the rhinoceros of rap (say what?)
Lil' Kim pussy (uhh) how preposterous is that? (ha hah!)

No licky licky -- fuck the dicky dicky
And the quickie, gimme your loot
Your Mac-11 then shoot
Your game ain't sweet, John Paul peeps
Shouldn't compete, if you can't wet it, forget it
Don't sweat it, I bet it'd
Make ya cum smooth if you let it
Huh, you can't stop a bitch from ballin
Ha-ha to la-la to drive-by's they be callin, and you ain't know
While you be kickin that old shit (talk to me) we makin hits
Platinum and gold shit (we don't stop)
I stay draped in diamonds and pearls

California love
California knows how to party

In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

1996,Outkast,Elevators,"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly

Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dick now""

Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again

Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Somebody tell me why
One black morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party

[Verse 1: Magoo]
I fiend for all beats, like girls jump for dicks
Don't salt the next man, keep that Lindbergh shit
Up in the cut like gay niggas, in butt
I'm Black with Indian, my race should be mutt
I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius
Up in the sky, up high don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam, prepare to fuckin' die
Fuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight but I got ten more
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like Pop's feet, make sweat with no heat

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call Maganoo to see if he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car door
It costs too much money to get that shit fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time for the shucking and jiving
Peep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got
After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott
Me, my hot self, my self be so hot
Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop, uhh
Give it to me daddy and uhh
Yup, yup like Teddy
Teddy, ready with the one two checker
No Diggity, Missy be the bedroom wrecka
Double-decker, make you wanna beat your pecker
And then leave your bitch, cause this (uh) be better

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party

[Verse 4: Magoo]
Prepare to get wet like Jheri Curl juice
You tight like virgin pussy, my rap get you loose
I bump like acne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe without the fucking key
I cum cause I'm a nut, don't bleed when I'm cut
No fan of Madonna, she just a damn slut
So sit you damn dog and bow to my shit
Nit-wit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grits
Make fits like seizure, lick clit to please ya
I book then read ya, follow the leader
Like Jews and Chinese, I own your rap lease
The wackness must cease, prepare for your release

[Verse 5: Timbaland]
I'm up in these labels trying to handle my business
Been making more beats before Jehovah had Witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me
Brother brother, please, turn on the TV
See a Black man dead, from a White man's powder
See a White man scared, from a Black man's power
Back to reality
Please don't freaking smile at me
This is a stick-up so give up your wallet please

[Verse 6: Missy Elliott]
I'm the best, and that's B and that's capital
I hang low like testicles, MC's wanna copy these many flows
Hoes, better back up, foe they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell Mommy that I backed up you
You you you, and your whole screw
What, whatcha whatcha whatcha gon' do uhh, what whatcha gon' do
To me, the M-I-double S-Y-E
Wanna battle me, it's gonna be some tragedy

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party

We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party

Hah, sicker than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
(Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin'
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packin', askin', ""Who want it?""
You got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes go with Moschino
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie?
Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
""Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement""
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me

I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em with the force like Obi
Dick black like Toby
Watch me roam like Romey
Lucky they don't owe me

1997,Puff Daddy & the Family,Been around the world,"[Intro: Mase]
This Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

[Verse 1: Mase]
Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switching ve's with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded

Hey yo Mase, you know what I don't like?
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
And I'm with my honey
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
You got, you know, the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of a sudden

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

[Puff talking over Chorus]
Hit you with the ice grill, you know
Haha, 'cause your boys ain't with you
Little do they know, the girl roll harder than
Some of yo' niggas
You dig?

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?
I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy
Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough
'98 Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe
Case I'm ever chased by Donnie Brasco

[Chorus 2X: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Yo, I can't get mad 'cause you look at me
'Cause on the real, look at me
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear
Dissin' every year, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on your own
'Cause bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long 'til they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me? 'Cause I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy your wifey
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really would I know ya?
Now me and Blink float in a gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
'Cause Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

[Chorus 2X: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Make it hot baby, make it hot (Come on)
Make it hot baby, make it hot (Come on)

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
We was all at the Greek Fest, it's hot and sandy
I rent scooters, I'm with my family
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy
Who look good enough to be Miss Miami
But say since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
""He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?""
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies, 'cause wifey's with me

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

The name is Krayzie, big bad ass bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash I even took the mayor's daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with us so I brought her
Dun got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double-crossed by the law so it's nobody to run to
Yeah it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
I dun now call him 'Leatherface'
I'm headed for the west heard they got a couple banks in town
That ain't been held up yet, well uh, I ought to make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown
So I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark
So now I'm watching for them damn injuns
They like to catch up then they rob -n- split
I'll be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse
""Whoa nelly! Who in the bushes, you better speak up
Or I'mma let my shotgun's song sing out.""

[Thug Queen]
Who's this? Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

[Krayzie]
""Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry.""
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous

[Thug Queen]
""Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer.""

[Krayzie]
""Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes""

[Thug Queen]
""I'm wanted in 4 counties, for armed robbery, killed 2 sheriffs, 6 of his best men with my head
Stole 2 horses, thought you was the law that's why
I jumped in the bushes.""

[Krayzie]
""Goodness.""
Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire but I could use her for the job so I told her to ride
""Come on.""

[Thug Queen]
""May I ask you what you headed to the west for?""

[Krayzie]
""I got a partner got a plan for some dough and if you're down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute now be sure if you're with it.""

[Thug Queen]
""We be up before the sun rise got a stall(ion) here for your partner to ride hit the saloon before the moon shine down for whatever let's ride let's ride.""

[Krayzie]
""These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk

""I'm peepin' Krayzie's 'Wanted' poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glanced across the room I seen this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up tonight I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approached him and I paused
""Look man, I really don't wanna brawl, but won't you chill before them laws
Come messin' up this master plan
Since he already rowdy I'm just asked the man (dang)
You want some work well partner put in your bid
And by the way now what's your name, they call me Layzie the Kid.""

[Powder Pete]
""The name's Powder Pete, can I get a 12 gauge!
Outlaw every day, on the front page
Mister Kid, if you give me the low-down me and Blackjack
Be ready for the showdown, with 2 double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm pretty clever.""

[Layzie]
""So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon because it's all goin' down.""
I heard the guy runnin' the bar screamin' 'Krayzie's in town.'

[Krayzie]
""Now when we get to this saloon, you don't worry, wait outside
Don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses.""
Stepped inside the bar
""Layzie Kid you son of a gun!""

[Layzie]
""Hey man I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun

[Powder Pete]

Lend me your ears, Uhh (Oh yeah that's right, Oh yeah that's right)

Hear my cries

Lend me your ears
See my fall
See my errors
Know my faults
Time halts
See my loss
Know I'm lacking
Backtracking
Where I met you
Pistol packing
Itchy finger
Trigger happy
Try to trap me
Bad rap
Wiretap me
Backstab me
Break the faith
Fall from grace
Tell me lies
Time flies
Close your eyes
Come with me

Come with me x8

I'm gonna take you with me
I want to fight you
I'll fucking bite you
Can't stand nobody like you
You can't run

I'm here to stay
Forever ever
And ever and day that's never

We grind ya'll
Bounce back, open your mind ya'll
Grind your whole ass till you twist your waistline
Ya'll know the time
Hey yo feel the base line
Stack the overdrive
Bounce, baby feel the incline
So genuine, every time, Busta redefine
The wicked knew the dime
Makin' y'all press rewind
Hope you feelin' fine
Watch me combine and intertwine
The bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine
On all kinds of little swine
Stick the worst of porcupine
If you tryin' to take mine
Yo, pick up my nigga Spliff
In the blue 5S's
Sportin' out tan, interior blue head rests
Move, baby no time for second guesses
Been articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses
Yo we gettin' papers spreadin' love and happiness's
Shit blazin' so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo' hot baby

[Chorus]
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby

[Verse 2]
Yo, word is bond
Baby let's get it on
I never say it wrong
Yo baby girl take off your thong
Let me put it in your spirit like the holy Qur'an
Got the mega song
Sweet like honey chicken Dijon
Movin' along
Yo, honey body look real strong
Watch your ass swing
Hangin' like a medallion
Exercise baby let me see you spread on the floor
What you askin' for?
Relax, I'm bout to give you some more
Where the liquor store?
Hit you with some more metaphor
The raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before
Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin' their neck
Yo we play to win
Such a shame, shit is a sin
So hot baby body heat bubble your skin
Every time I flow speak
I caress the whole beach
Just like the body guard Les straight walkin' the street
We get down

[Chorus]
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby

[Verse 3]
Yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin' to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin' dough
When we rippin' the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin' grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to sky scrape
Like blah!
So hot

1998,Lauryn Hill,Doo Wop,"[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again
Come again
Come again
Come again

And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

And live the lifestyle that Robin Leach talkin' about
Slow down player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Will it enable to shoot C-Note ""Yo's"" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
A nigga fly and fly, with the desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle

I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dog, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check

1999,Puff Daddy ft. R. Kelly,Satisfy you,"[Puffy]
All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

[R. Kelly-Hook]
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Verse 1]
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

[Hook]

[R. Kelly-Bridge]
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

[Verse 3]
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X go down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

You wondered how you'd make it through

You're looking for

You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook 1: LV]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook 1]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Hook 1]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1995,tlc ,waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

The light that you shine can't be seen?

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I would be forever thankful baby
You are the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You are the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see

Lifted me up when I could not reach

I am everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I am grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I do not know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

And I'm crying inside

How could I let my angel get away

I'm screamin' at night as if I thought
You'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
Yeah, this right here (tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you

One black morning
When this life is over

Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See, I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)

And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow

You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start

[Verse 1]
You said you'd be here by 9
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit, tryin' not to cry
Askin' myself why, you do this to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

[Chorus]
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me

[Verse 2]
Now I see, that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along and made a fool of me baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me, baby how could u do it to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

[Chorus]
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
You didn't have to do it to me baby

2000,faith hill,breathe ,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 1]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 2]
In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know
And you know
There's no need for words right now

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush

2000,santana ft rob thomas,smooth,"Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu–equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Hook A]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Hook B]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

[Hook A]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Hook B]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Hook B]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

2000,vertical horizon ,everyhting you want ,"Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know",Pop,5
